                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and

                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                    printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make 
                    a type specimen book. It has survived not only five 
                    centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
                    the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 
                    publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
                    of Lorem Ipsum.
